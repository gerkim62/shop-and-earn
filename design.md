# Cute Purple Theme Description

Our established theme for pages (eg offline, 404, error) combines a soft purple color palette with friendly design elements to create a cute, approachable aesthetic. Here are the key components of our theme:

## Color Palette

1. Background: bg-purple-50

   - A very light purple that provides a soft, calming backdrop

2. Primary Text: text-purple-800

   - A deep purple for headings, offering good contrast and readability

3. Secondary Text: text-purple-600

   - A medium purple for body text, maintaining the theme while ensuring legibility

4. Icon Color: text-purple-300

   - A light purple for large icons, adding visual interest without overwhelming the design

5. Button/Accent: 

   - Background: bg-purple-100

   - Text: text-purple-700

   - Hover: bg-purple-200

   - Creates a subtle yet clickable button that fits the overall theme

## Layout and Components

1. Full-screen layout:

   - min-h-screen ensures the content is centered vertically on any screen size

   - Flex container for easy centering of content

2. Content Card:

   - White background (`bg-white`)

   - Rounded corners (`rounded-xl`) for a soft, friendly appearance

   - Subtle shadow (`shadow-md`) for depth

   - Centered on the page with responsive padding

3. Large Icon:

   - Prominently displayed at the top of the card

   - Often accompanied by a small, cute accent (like a question mark or exclamation point)

4. Typography:

   - Large, bold headings for clear communication

   - Friendly, concise messages in a slightly smaller font

5. Button:

   - Rounded shape (`rounded-full`) for a cute, bubbly look

   - Subtle shadow and hover effect for interactivity

   - Often includes an emoji for added cuteness

## Design Philosophy

1. Simplicity: Clean layouts with ample white space

2. Friendliness: Rounded shapes, cute icons, and approachable language

3. Consistency: Similar structure and styling across different non-standard pages

4. Responsiveness: Designs that look good on various screen sizes

5. Accessibility: Good color contrast and clear interactive elements

This theme strikes a balance between being visually appealing and functional, providing users with a pleasant experience even when encountering issues like being offline or reaching a non-existent page.
